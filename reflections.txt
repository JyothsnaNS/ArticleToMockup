Answer the following questions:
  

* What new skills have you learned?
  

I learnt how to format HTML with tags such as <p>,<i>,<b>,<img>,<a>,<hr> and <sup>

* What has been easy?
 

Looking up things on the The MDN element reference has been an enjoyable experience!
 
* What has been difficult?
 

Nothing very difficult here since this project was added to the course after I had completed my P3-Game Clone project. Since I had already learnt the basics of html formatting, this wasn't so difficult.
